# cljctools archived
Date: 2020-11-06  

- <s>initially created the "project" (not really, /clcjtools a nor here nor there namespace) to start working there on [mult (editor extenion)](https://github.com/cljctools/mult/blob/35d93ea4af3f2c586d29fa2ae8f5ce74d6096e41/docs/design.md#rationale)
- however, it should've been either `github.com/username/mult` or `github.com/mult/mult`: too often we make a mistake of starting amorphous organizations instead of focusing on value, trying to put the internet and everyone into a "my-precious" namespace - and that is what I shamefully did here
- clojure is on the contrary an example of a natural and unambiguous namespace - it is named after the title repo (`tool/tool`), so it's a tool and it's derivatives 
- I moved repos to personal namespace and explicitly archived `cljctools` - to not repeat the mistake of org-building again and focus on being the maker</s>

UPDATE (same day):
- I'm wrong. I need that namespace both to avoid collisions and because it's dream
- don't know, probably moment of weekness/disbelief...
- I do apologize for mischievous post
