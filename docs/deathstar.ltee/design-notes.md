## switch account feature like in youtube

- to be able to open multiple tabs and easily select identity


## explore the idea of building without sockets for simplicity

- submit user code and get updates via http requests
- if that is limiting, definitely go for socket or sse

## thinking how to use graphql, async ops with status, app logic

## explore existing self-hostable systems with sane design, re-purpose for the game

- consider systems out there that have all the intangibles - graph data layer, identity, ops, logic in a decoupled apps,reverse-proxy, simplicity...
- fork, replace apps and logic with game app(s) and processes, replace gui etc.

## app should be an extension of the system

- system should be runnable on it's own, with identity, reverse proxy, database
- apps and their ui should (even dynamically) come into the system and access data layer etc.
- apps and ui are logic, while identity, netwroking, data layer are part of the system


## apps are esentailly processes (intances), so they never talk via http, only via queue/peer abstactions

- if app needs to perform operation on another app, it does so by abstract request/push to *central* thingy: "hey, system, so this", not to each other

## identity: provider auth contradicts the design of deathstar.ltee, so identity is always self

- providers require to register apps, which would make the system not actually self-hosted

## indentity: possible to implement auth using DID (decentralized identifiers) as they seem to be the next gen and global

- is ti correct to assume,that with DID a user can login into different servers (with fresh dbs) and still maintain identity? because it's a private key file?
- can(are there tools/info) a browser UI use DIDs to auth into the system?
- where will users store DID? on some IPFS provider? "login with IPFS" ? or in browser storage ? on disk?
- is it possible: no tokens, no sessions, no passwords stored and crap - every request/message has a DID as identifier?  

## multiple apps, multiple uis, gateway and queue, apps talk via gateway

- identity ui (seprate, redirects)
- multiplayer ui (separate app behind it)
- graphiql ui (to do arbitrary queries agains data/history)
- history/stats/wiki type thingy ui (as a separate app)

## IPFS/libp2p is for users/peers netwroking, while browser and docker apps still need a single bidirectional async/sync protocol to talk within a system

- even in web3.0 decentralized global app, a user (peer) will run an instance of a system - a docker deployment
- system instance on a user machine is always comprised of apps (services/containers)
- a user will open localhost:port to access game ui, which will talk to the instance (system) running on the same machine
- and that instance - apps, db, gui serving containers .. - will talk to IPFS peer node and through it reach other peers and form a global cluster/mesh of the game
- and that's where libp2p plays its role, to exchange data between peers
- but: the inter-process (microservice) communication on a singel manchine, between containers and browser ui - it requires a protocol approach different from libp2p
- it's a generic question of comprising a system of processes (microservices), and it should be a generic bidirectional protocol, agnostic(same) to apps and browser
- in simple words: browser ui apps and docker apps (db, queues, apps,gateway, uis) should all talk async/sync bidirectional protocol (e.g. RSocket) 

## imagining stuff: rsocket and netifi+traefik-like router
