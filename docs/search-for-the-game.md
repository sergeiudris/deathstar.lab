## what

- Starnet
  - a board-like game
  - with a server and regular events(tournaments)
  - complete, free and open to everyone
  - to be worthy of a scene and community around

## on games in general

- games are fundamentally magic, one of the better ways for beings to interact
- games are being 'produced', but suprisingly, there are no events to play
  - most games are micro heavy, dark, including the classics
  - monetization noise is unhelathy and disturbing
  - events(tournaments) are rare, not for everyone, brackets are on separate services
  - prolifiration of the idea that the player must be an unhealthy aggry yob, seeking for life-replacing occupation that is also 10-hour-a-day-or-bust
  - force into one mindset: compete for resources, collect more, bring opponent down
- there is a glaring need for games that are
  - simplier, lighter, have no micro
  - have a map (board)
  - are a service, can be played/observed in a browser, events and brackets included
  - are complex and interesting enough to be worhty of a community around
  - are moneytization free, come as whole available for everyone, no forced 'if you don't play, you have limit access to updates'

## observations

- HoMM3
  - AI battles are repetetive
  - little role of combining enetities
  - simulteneous turns save the day
- AoE, Starcraft
  - micro heavy
- Hearthstone Battlegrounds
  - mode is brilliant
- Terraria
  - softer graphics, but still dark
  - amazing idea and design

## user experience

- events (tournaments, matches) are at the center, home page contains official events and most upvoted
  - games tend to have reasonable duration time, so most events have estimatable start and finish time, they can be  planned for
  - event rounds start at X, no waiting for the opponent
  - official events start at X, not when full
  - users can create events (invite only or public), unset time constraints
- players have rating, rating can be reset
- all games are public and can be observed
- the game opens in a tab, so can be always reopened/reconnected
- users can
  - press 'find an opponent' and be auto matched against most equal opponent (or can decline)
  - enter an event
  - create/configure an open/invite-only  event
  - browse events (with a filter)
  - join a game
  - create an open/invite-only game (no title, match description has a format)
  - browse open games (with a filter)
  - create lists of
    - other users
    - events
    - users and events
    - as there will be no limitations like 'add to friends' 'follow' etc. - user creates their own lookup lists
  - export (to load, exahnge) game as data
    - load can be a url to a file (edn or transit, possibly edn for readabiity)
- no chat
- user profile has rating and event results (can be reset)
- official and community map templates and configurable events
- pre game bans, selections
- observing
  - select templates (simple detailed) for game info/stats [templates are components]
- tournament time frames
  - tounaments preferably have estimatable, evening/a day timeframe
    - once signup ends, bracket is form, countdown to round 1 begins
    - player sees 'upcoming match in X:X;
    - game starts automatically or player can decline and take a default loss
    - once round ends, next countdown begins
    - players can see the brackets and schedule
  - tounaments can be configured to have natuaral timeframe
    - all standard
    - to observe or play the game user clicks the match in the bracket, gets into the game lobby or game itself
    - players can mutually agree to nullify the result and re-play
- game history and replays
  - after game is fninished, game data is trasacted to db
  - players can browse game history and watch replays
  - games are also persisted in clients filesystem, can load a replay via a file

## game world

- defend starnet, one shot opportunity of preventing launch of netconrol (controldrone)
- research, change, build, balance a missiondrone and a team (a hero and research drones)
  - the winner's missiondrone and team will take on the mission of protecting startnet from netcontrol's takeover
- planets & teleports, remote controlled drones, ships
- single map
- start: teleport to the map (a planet)
- players play for competing/fighting team, both thinking their missiondrone and team will perform better than opponents, so better build wins
- entities vary, sets, tags, combinations: code,warp drives, fields, elements, fruit, self orient time .. etc.
- characters, reserach drones start from 0

## game features

- a tiled map
- player collects varios items, chooses different options, experiencing effects to build a better missionship
- game is values-transparent with little things to learn, provides calculations, more focuss on the picture and decisions, less arithmetics
- maps , items quantities and even qualities are randomized
- randomness on initial generation only
- optimal game time ~15-90 min

## game completeness

- game completeness, balance, so complete set of entities, no bloating expansions
  - entities have tags(sets): gathering organic discovery etc.
  - droids
    - drive types 
    - research abilities
    - distance speed
  - combine parts compute fields drives etc.
  - research quality
  - compute capabilities
  - decision making accuracy, energy, vision, vitality

## gameplay

- players (azure and orange) start on the map, charachter is represented with a cape
- 1 hero, 3 research drones (represented with a colored sphere)
- missiondrone is represented with a large sphere (possible made of nanites) and orbiting supporting spheredrones
- map is visible and open to both opponents equally, 128x128
- players are not competing for resources, what one can get, the other can as well
- players choose their initial position on the map 
- research, collect, rebalance, by roaming the map
- players choose what to visit and collect, make choices, balance the missiondrone's and the team's characterisitics
- players see each others moves, but not choices (the missiondrone build, team's stats etc.)
- player can visit a fruit tree to improve certain skills of a hero, for example, or visit and select nanite modules for the missiondrone
- players have limited moves per day, limited days (say, 7)
- total time for 7 days - 15min
- every 5 mins there is an battle simulation, 30sec per move, 3rd battle is final
- in the battle goal is to disable(defeat) opponent's mission drone
- hero and research drones are engaged and support (they also develop skills and abilities)
- no distance
  - movement in terms of energy spent at places, maybe increasable limit on how many places can be visited
  - visiting a lot should not matter though 
- missiondrone attributes
  - compute capabilities
  - data bank
  - knowledge bank
  - independent agent programs (for unpredictability)
  - fields
  - networking range
  - design quility
  - human interface simplicity
  - abstraction level (like an age in AoE)
  - defensive/offensive resources
  - energy
  - ...
- hero
  - accuracy
  - decisionmaking
  - resolve
  - drone design 
  - reach (movement)
  - creativity(ideas)
  - endurance (energy)
  - vision
- reserach drone
  - reach
  - reserach capabilites
  - absctraction level
  - fields
  - hull
  - energy
  - hoisting (carrying) capacity

## assets

- use s-expressions to gen svg
- colors, lines, shapes (for cape, spheres, facilities, skills, fruit tree etc.)
- use DOM for the board, but keep it simple - details and info in windows/popups/panels
- file per asset, little to no shared code, an asset as sexp, use lib, render into canvas/svg/png
- gen assets into files, preload, set as sources to tiles
- if needed, run assets as code (render into svg/canvas) in enetity information window, 
- point is: assets are code, files are generated
- but first: events, words, simple shapes; assets will form last

## documentation

- github repo with .md files
- docs, anouncements, release notes: simple dirs with index.md containing links to file per posting


## system design

- CPS communicating sequential processes
  - https://www.infoq.com/presentations/clojure-core-async/
    - "function chains are poor machines
    - "good programs should be made out of processes and queues
    - "the 'api du jours' events/calbacks - Definition of du jour. 1 : made for a particular day
    - "external flow state
  - https://clojure.org/news/2013/06/28/clojure-clore-async-channels
  - https://github.com/clojure/core.async
- datastore soultion
  - allows connections from multiple apps, querying, searching
  - options: datomic dgraph
- routing, https
  - traefik
- on data
  - clients emit events
  - server persists minimal state (raw events) in memory, acts as coordinator or/and broadcaster
  - clients compute state
  - after game is finished, server trasacts game data to database, players can browse history
  - games are autosaveed on the client as well: to file system via browser extension
  - if server goes down, game can be restored from save files

## identity

- ideally should be implemented via providers (github google twitch ..)
  - system apps should be completely unaware of identity process, only receiving user's identity (or key to get it) along with request
  - signup, singin, change of password, auth, authz, web interface, support existing providers -  should be abstracted into a service (with plugins and/or client)
  - all existing names in different provider domains should be already reserved for users of the new system
    - to avoid name collisions provider domain should be used to fully qualify a name
    - e.g. github.com/user1 and google.com/user1 may belong to different users, but should be unique in the system
  - users should be able to link accounts, merge accounts - history etc., name of the account is one of the merged
  - system is free to have its own user abstraction and data, with identity being handled by a decoupled layer
- however, as of now, exising providers auth is not yet automated
  - you have to manually (via provider's web interface) register apps, provide urls and use keys
  - unlike let's encrypt project, which automates tls
- implementing your own custom identity (not oauth) is a step back and a waste
- considering all that
  - system should run its own oauth provider service and identoty service as the client
  - the resulting layer should be self-contained and decoupled from the system, may have its own db
  - existing providers can be added later when proper tooling(automation) is created



## notes on implementation

- figwheel main if it's less cpu consuming than shadow-cljs
- search
  - used only for events, games, users
- data and secutiry
  - user account data only exists in user.data
  - if user deletes their account, it gets removed from user.data (kafka tombstone event)
  - in the system (event brackets, stats etc.) it get's shown as 'unknown' (only uuid is used in other topics)
- v0.1 ux
  - users creates a game -> game.data
  - browser tab opens
  - user changes settings of the game -> game.data
  - once finished, user presses 'invite' or 'game ready' or 'open' -> game.data game becomes visible in the list and joinable
  - opponent joins ( if rating >= specified by the host in settings) -> game.data
  - more settings, bans, both press 'ready' -> game.data
  - host presses 'start the game' -> game.data
  - all ingame events are sent through ingame.events topic
  - if user closes the tab, they can reopen it from 'ongoing games' list -> get current state snapshots from game.data and ingame.events
  - after the game has started, host can't cancel it
- app's proc-streams is wrong: should be a process per streams app, imported and started exlicitly with args
- buffer size 1 chans with peek and ? possible ? to convey db connections etc. Or is there another way ? Single process per connection + messages
  - (recur conn) to be able to close or smth before new is taken from the queue
- localStorage tokens: user1 token user2 token ... for multiple tabs
- no ffing sessions
- css via classes
- system
  - share connections via channels ? yes
    - db process handles db connection and db calls
    - first interceptor does not add db conn to ctx: it adds db process channel
    - query/tx interceptors open a go block, create a channel and put it on db channel with db fn symbol argv for db fn, and block until channel receives the result
    - db ns contains fns that take conn and args, so can be arbitrarily complex
    - the db channel takes all db calls - tx or queries - and launches non-blocking sub processes with that interceptor created channel and db args as args
    - a sub process is a go block that awains the result of the db call and puts it directly on the interceptor channel
    - interceptor go block returns with the db call result
    - error handling and reporting ?
    - testing
      - generate data using spec and fdef for db fn when inside the subprocess's go block
      - so in one case db request is made, in another generated data
      - so spec query fns
      - also test the chain fromthe request side with generated data
  - some of the processes
    - connections: db kafka
    - socket: into-channel/connect/disconnect/broadcast
    - kafka: producer arbiter
  - db is a lib, error handling in layers (http, socket, kafka)
  - db has all logic, interceptors only call
  - on no db in interceptors throw, appropriate response for errors (via match)
- namespacing
  - consolidate processes in main
  - crux, http, streams as a file
- channels
  - def channels as a map :name (chan)
  - destructure arg in proc itself
  - pass to process with (select-keys) to explicitly see what process depends on
  - it's infinitely worth it to use both (sleect-keys) + destructiring 
  - interceptors 
    - pass channels explicitly in main within http process
    - pedestal server is already a process
    - interceptors allow to make decisions inside that process
    - interceptors handle http (forming response maps), not actual domain logic
    - put logic into core ns, where each fn takes 1 arg - channels and returns a channel
    - this way interceptors are free of non-http decision making
- performance
  - performance-wise it is a question, whether or not connection should be accessed via a process or as a ref
  - and other considerations may arise
  - approach
    - test/perf will contain independent ns (apps) with their own entry points
    - once user abstraction is implemented and tested, copy a snapthot of the app into test/perf/alpha-channels1
    - and into test/perf/alpha-refs1
    - change refs1, test both
    - this way is better to reason about what option is better, than comlecting src files to handle all cases
- sockets
  - proc-socket accepts connections
  - proc-socket spawn sub-porcess per created game, which broadcasts events from users and sends them to kafka
  - once game is closed, sub-proc closes connections
  - when user reconnects, subproc conveys msg that game state is needed, gets it and sends to the reconnected user
  - games are looked up in a globalktable
  - only finished/selected games and events are persisted to db
  - user events, processed by subproc, are sent (non-block) to kafka and globalktable gets updated
  - kconsumer may not be required
- authtication and authorization
  - primary (and may be only) way to ligin will be using google, github, etc.
  - but username/pass login system will be there until 1.0
  - username is unique, users can change username freely
  - creating account data: username pass email(won't be used) and possibly questions to remeber pass
  - data is persisted in db, gktable [uuid user-rec] is updated
  - no need to [username user-rec] lookup: on login db query will do
  - authenticaiton is stateless using JWS/JWE, encoding user uuid and expiration
  - on requests, token is decoded into uuid and user record (with authorization info as well) is looked up in gktable
- proc-arbiter
  - on game events (:created :started) vals will be put on queue with insts and (timeout x) for when arbiter needs to emit and event to game
  - so if no events happen , timeouts (but not intervals, created by events) will be (alts!) and proc will close/remove the game
  - would be nice not to interval for every game, queue is preferred
  - once-a-few hours (timeout []) may be enqueued to remove stale games
- game events on the client and disconnect
  - the process will aplly events to the state and send to the server
  - if disconented, explicit non-blocking 'reconnecting' message will be shown
  - ui will sta responsive, game will be explorable, but the events will not be applied to state (execpt local ui related)
  - but the process will discard all events (vals on queue) that require connection
  - once reconnected, event conveyance will resume
- client and server exhange
  - it is a synchronization of state between to core.async processes over two channels(queues)
- queues, processes, rendering and derived state
  - react is an out/in: renders ui and collects inputs
  - reagent solves the update problem: components can selectively deref atoms or cursors and update lazily
  - inputs will put! vals on channles and processes will make requests
  - however, ui requires a lot of derived state
  - when a button click will initiate request, proccess will handle it and put! response on a queue
  - but for ui that is not enough: there should be loading state and derived state, that will most likely be used in multiple compoenets
  - with loading solution is a process, that will sub to certain queues and will be updating a derived state atom with data like [:some-logic :in-progress] [:some-logic :complete]
  - components will opt-in by derefing that atom and render
  - however, some state will contain a lot of conditional logic and will need to depend on other derived state
  - possible solution: 
    - communication is done via channles only, obviuosly
    - represent derived state as a reagent atom or atoms
    - a process or processes sub to channels and update derived state
    - components react to atoms or with cursor
    - there are also fns created with .e.g. '(derived-state (fn [ctx  old-val c-out] (let [a (deref :x) b (deref :y)] ...))
    - they compute some derived state and put! it on a channel
    - that value becomes a :key in derived state atom(s)
    - but these functions, alike reagent components, must be auto-invoked whenever atoms/cursors they deref change
    - they may be a go block and make async calls
  - on reagent's ratom
    - https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent/blob/master/src/reagent/ratom.cljs
    - track and track! allow to create derived state values that are first class RAtoms
    - but: they don't allow for fns to return go-block (channel), unlike pedestal, which is built with async
    - this can be added: if returned value is a channel, take! and apply result on arrival (via take! callback)
    - approach
      - go without async derived values
      - if they are neccessary, fork-implement
- queues, processes, rendering and derived state 2
  - use datascript as store for data
  - a create-user button click for the system is create-user value on the queue
  - an proc-http is subbed performs a request
  - a proc-transactor is subbed and performs datascript txns from vals
  - a proc-derived-state-ui is subbed and has a mapping from value types (:inputs/create-user :http-response/create-user ...) to db query keys (:query-1 :query-2 ...)
  - it queries the db (via a channel, sends query keys) and performs swap! on derived state (reagent atom) :query-1 val :query-2 val
  - only the corresponding ui (that has cursors to  :db :query-1 :db :query-2) will be updated
  - it may be better than rections as it brings a higher yet generic abstraction datalog
  - on practice, for ui those queries will be simple like getting loading state, current user etc, no need for relational logic
  - but: for the game it will be neccessary to query entities, so it may be benefitial overall
- project's idea and focus
  - the center of the project is the game and events, not user profiles
  - the scope is targeted at creating the game that shines, not pleasing or feature-bloating
  - thus, user profile is simple: a name and stats, event results 
  - home page is events, events are the core, more important than games
  - if user is in a game, it is shown (header/popup) so user could reopen it
  - creating a gmae means opening a tab with unique url, configuring it (e.g. host lists who is invited) and pressing open
  - after game is opened , others can open a link and press join
  - if game is private or deleted or not opened yet, opening a link will show 'game not found'
  - project is
    - /events - lists events, can join them (later may be introduced /events/hsitory or /events/data)
    - /games - lists games to join and/or ladder
    - /signup /singin /account  - basics to create a simple account
    - /stats/user/:username - a stats page showing user's stats
    - /game/:id - a unique url at which a game is played/observed
    - /event/:id - a unique url for an event
  - user's idetity (signup, account) consists of
    - credentials and a list of links
  - when user name is hovered/clicked, popup shows username, links and a link to /stats/user/username
  - game and event can also have a list of links (can be changed by host)
  - system has no chat by design
- events history, stats and data
  - games are played on a topic
  - once game is complete, a kstreams app should start
    - it will filter, map(xform) games and output transactable data
    - data is transacted into a separate history(stats) crux db (that has its own topics
    - and the data can be queried with datalog
- db ops
  - db ops should be named keywords, remove 'how' assoc-in-* etc) -> :db.op/this :db.op/that (including datalog queries, keywords for which are also needed to update queries)
- game.cljc
  - spec
  - derived state fns
  - reagent components
  - ? proc-game
  - derived-core is both palin data (for kstreams inference) and a ratom (for ui)
  - :g.state/core  is events and :g.state/derived-core - this is what server knows
  - other state is derived, is in ratoms with tracks 
  - track fns may use core logic
  - may transact to datascript, use :named/queries which are requries on events and results are keys on the map and can be (r/cursor)
  - ui import game as a lib, runs the proc with args, and conveys data via a channel
- gameplay
  - first, generate entities
    - strive for templates: parametarized generation, possibly in layers, with regions
    - start simple: using tesk.check, generate within given proportions
  - game map has min max x and y
  - there are no tiles: only positions (coordinates) of entities
  - when entity is enters, it has a position
  - once generated, entties go into datalog db
  - movement on the map is free as in no pathing
  - it is about spending/restoring energy, focus by taking different actions
  - distance only matters in that you spend energy etc.
  - also areas (fields etc.) matter, but going from point A to B is a straint line, but some resources will be spent/gained
  - interacting with map enetities leads to everything else
  - e.g.
    - :e.g/move-cape
    - event is applied to state
    - db query 'what else is in cape's position' is recomputed
    - track! reacts to :db.query/what-else-in-capes-pos change and computes data for a display/popup
    - inputs(buttons) are rendered with cape's options
    - user  inputs/clicks (it's optional of course, can just move to another pos) -> futher events
  - pool of positions, from whcih entities draw
    - pool can be divied into subsets that represent regions
    - entites can draw with contraints(template) applied
  - color of the tile and other tile-specific values
    - derived state, that is computed with track!
    - for example, a db query 'what are combined field values for tiles' updates, track updates {[x y] {:color new-val-representing-combined-field}}
    - same for drawing circles (that are field range): db query find all entites that have fields, their fields, track computes circles, renderer draws
  - entities qualities
    - are actually generated and differer every time (within a limit of a set)
    - and every quality gets random value as well
    - qualities are tupled(can be 2 3 4 for example) and player can choose a tuple
  - fields also vary on generation
  - when map is created, positions of entities align with a template, but are random and entities(fields) have new qualities
  - players are in equal positions always: after map is generated, there is no randomness, and both players can interact with any entity , no race/first-come condition
- assets, generation & serialization
  - generate assets into Blob and use with createObjectURL, or pre-render to use with (r/as-element)
  - an asset is code (a function)
  - if needed, generating can be done on worker thread
  - to avoid hitting ui thread with heavy deserialization (worker sends bytes or string)
    - send event :start-generation to worker
    - worker generates in batches and sends events :generated-batch 1 of 10 2 of 10 etc
    - finally, :generation-complete event, which trigger ui change
    - while it's in process, ui thread is completely free and responsive, with no serialization spikes
- queues and processes
- protocols
- simplicity: bad abstractions are worse than no abstractions
- a process (service) may have its own runtime (container) 
- app = process, apps are smart
- connections and channels are global defined (on top of service's main), explicit
- development through traefik(http) and docker-compose
- lein + deps with lein-deps-plugin
- apps know database and http, no communication queue required
- game can be played (state-wise) from cljc repl
- consider electron


# starnet gameplay 20-06-02

- map, entities and even som eprinciples are generated, and may be as unique as uuids/hashes: so basically, every game (set) is unique
- player don't focus on collecting or moving, but rather on assembling, solving
- you can look at the screen for two minutes (only highlighting entites) and come up with an arrangement (of team memebers, droids etc.)
- e.g. if you position beings too closely, they lose freedom and creativity and in later rounds the composition will be inferior
- otoh, if you position two isolated, the flow on infomation breaks and it also may not be optimal
- players think and compose, and within an interval compositions are tested, after that players can improve further
- players have exact same opportunities and resources, only initial generation is random
- players can see each others compositions with maybe a few in-flight (not yet commited) details concealled
- so game is about creating a compoosition given uniquely generated map/entities/principles, with only core principles being consistent
- the better/clearer a player thinks, the more games they will come up with a functioning system/composition


# notes

- no portion-feeding
  - game map should be visible/open-to-understanding from the beginning
  - so the player knows their options and can build towards final composition
  - some things may become available on certain conditions, but they are completely transparent
  - there's no capping of a palyers though process: if palyer opts, they can think start-to-end
  - along with: randomness on-gen-only, equal resources, players see each others progress and decisions
- language principle
  - would be great to game build process be via a language



# building is about developing a language

When we build, we describe the phenomena using words, and compose those to achieve the desirable result.

For example, physics is like a giant repository that contains functions (words that describe physics phenomena). 
Scientists use existing funtions to describe new findings and observations, give it new names and commit.
As an example, physists explore and strudy the behaviors observed on micro level. They chose to call the elements particles.
Some kinds of particles may very well be just one particle behaving differently. When/if such understanding is reached, it will be the new word  (function) in the repository of physics knowledge (language).
And current names of particles will become deprecated. 
So physics is about describing the system of material world in a language. It's like getting the working operating system and writing down its api. As you go, you add/deprecate methods.

Same applies to the speaking laguanges themselves. We start with creatings symbols for sounds, so we could speak what we write.
Then we assign words to things, emotiions, patterns of thought, behaviors. And use those to compose larger abstractions.
And this languge is constantly growing on the level of 'higher api' - new words. We don't change symbols, but we, again, add/deprecate words as we observe new phenomena.

In programming, abstractions of elements, arrays, vectors, maps etc. exists. These words transcend languages, they describe the phenomena on the level of logic, they way we think.
They abstract, same way as math, elements and sets and what can be done with them. 

So it's aobut the language that makes the process of creating/composing truely free and least bounded.

To make the game about compsing and building, players should have access to the basic elements of the system and compose their solution.
The base of the game should be a set of elements, the language that can be applied to generated elements to build a solution.

Preferably, the game should not be using it's own language and entities, but rather provide an abstraction for existing phenomena, so that a person could realte to the enetites and principles of the game.
Most games create their characters and behaviors and relations - so you have to learn the words and numbers to understand the damages, for example. 
But things like adding (when units collect something) or movement etc. are realtable: if units in a strategy game collect stone, it is relatable and adding is logical.
But composing of things is always arbitrary and limited: you can only compose units/elements in a predefined and completely arbitrary way.

To the point:
The desired approach is to give players language-level compsing ability.
It is much better to use an actual laguage rather than creating your own.
But the programming laguage should be (optionally) abstracted away from players in a cool way.
So , for example, a player sees some-amazing-device and can apply it and get the effect. Device is fuction partition-by.
So the player sees both the game-world name 'some-amazing-device' and the effect - partition-by.
Moreover, player should be given higher, game specific abstactions for compsing processes and queues and other higher-level abstactions, but still usable as an language (api of funtions).
Player can do it graphically or type it in.

The elements of the game are generated at the start. Players use the language of the game (which is an actual language) to truely build their soltuions.
The boundaries are natural: the map caontains only what was generated, to players are building from those elements. And since generation is always ramdomized and
almost always unique, the resulting build compositions may also be quite different.
The qualities and characteristics of generated elements can be themseles randomized.

For example, players may have a goal of building a droid. They literally compose it from exiting elemnts and use the language to program the droid.
Say, you could do smth like '(go (doseq (range 0 2) (<! (timeout 300)) (emit-some-field)  ))'.
emit-some-field comes from generation. It is a function that is represented by a cool-named-device for example.
So the player builds the droid as a system and then droid will do things.
When droids interact, those behaviors will be exectuted.

This way the game gives players the ability to build systems/mechanism only bound by the map generation.
It is unlimiting and fun: you could configure game to be simplier of go fo mutli-hour compettions with more sopishticated systems.

The objective should be part of the map template and can be anything.
For example, players may be given a set of elements to build something(a droid) that would defeat the opposing build.
One player can build a sophisticated droid, another a cloud of micro mahcines, antoher a 5 droid squad etc.
Another example, player may need to build a system that exposes an 'api' (has to provide certain behaviors).
Then system are 'tested' and a better one wins.

Decouling:
A better approach is to not couple things (by wrapping), but connect.
For example, instead of exposing a partial language inside the game, it's better to use the actual language (as-is),
but a player can only operate on the provided data (map elements).
Editor: players can choose to use graphical insterface of the game for interaction or to use code.
If code, again, instead of building a pseudo editor, it is better to provide an existing one with an option to use another.
Maybe the game can be an extension for an existing editor ? Or expose files to be opened with an editor.
The point is to keep the language the languge, the editor the editor, and provide game boundaries by exposing bounded data and game apis, instead of wrapping. 

Exploring the map and buidling: REPL
Both players can see the map. They have editors open (may be just one virtual or real file).
They can evaluate expressions and explore the map (data).
For example,  different 'field-generators' are on the map. You can '(count (filter #(= type filed-genrator) map-data ))' and get ,say, 5 .
You can check what happens when two fields interact. It may also be seen on the may if mouse clicked or hovered.
Then you can program your droid to deflect ceratian kind of attacks, for example: (when (and field-1 field-2) ...).

Players expose the resulting s-expression(s), droids engage in a battle. Players then adjust. Finally, the winner is determined.
This is just an example, map templates can have different objectives.

So map is graphically represented, as well as the mechanisms/syshtems players are building.
Building can be done via an editor or (maybe) the pane that shows the build also allows for interactive programming.

Generated map data (entities) - droid parts, fields, systems, networks, fruit trees, nanites or any other anything - may both be data and have an api.
Similar to physical devices having api, in-game (virtual) devices may have an api.

What is shown on the screen is template dependent. Since entities and devices (functions, api available for palyers, for example, 'mix' function)
are available for palyers from the beginning, no repetetive  collecting - straight to buidling the solution, map can consist, for example, of 
what-is-available section (that can be sorf of a map or list, but positions do not matter - in essence, it is a set) and solution section  (that may contain whatever),
where the soltion is built, tested and final competetion will take place.
It can be a battle. Or Efficiency. Or, for example, two rovers exploring some palnet (which does best), or even some positional/movement competition or anything else.
What template is about is limited only by imagination. Template is a game in itself. 

It can be even, that templates may not be needed: every game may be built standalone, but be using shared librarires for this kind of games.
The point is, it should be clear gow to create new maps/templates/games/challenges like extensions or something. 
For example, it may be an extension of the editor that uses git url to resolve to games-templates, so that players can install all or specific tempaltes, games.
But be able to create arbitrary mixed competetions: say, a tournamnet where a,b,c templates are used with certain conditions. This configuration of a tournamnet
should be gittable, so it could be reused later. 
This way, tournament tamplates can be freely created and re-used via a git repo (sub)url.

The solution space (section, plane) obviously has some state and maybe apis. Players' prgrams can infer needed data.
For example, there can be a constantly changing field of a kind. So programs may read the state of the field and use that information.
Or it can be positions. Or anything else that is that template/space specific. A droid may have an automated nav system that constantly reads changin properties of
the space enviroment and adjusts droids position. 
Point is, the reosurce space has data, where elements/phenomena may have apis. The solution space may have data (again, elements may have apis), api and state.

One game, many scenarios.
This is one game. But it may have varoius scenarios.
The game allows players to connect and ,for example, create various tournamnets.
Players can choose which scenarios and how they will be used in the tournament. 
And can pre-configure scenarios for the tournament. This tournament setup can be saved and reused later (or shared via a url to be installed elsewhere).
Scenario represents a game, a unique challenge, a map. (For example, droid battle, or planet exploration etc.).
Scenarios can have its own tempalates and should have rich configuration.
Scenarios are addded as extensions. 
Game contains default scenarios, but more can be added using git url.

Observing.
Observers can ,as palyers, interact with the map.
Player's actions and current suild are seen. But if player prefers to think without any inout until final seconds, observers can just comment or try their ideas.
For example, say the scenario consists of 3-2-1-1 minutes rounds. During the first round palyer may choose to think for two minutes, and only then build a solution.
That is completely fine for observing, as the observer can fully interact with the reosurce and solution space.
After the first round, players current solution exists and can be always observed.

## Examples of scenarios:

Droids.
See above.

Planets.
Players start by building droids/rovers using what is provied by the resource space. 
Players are free to build one or multiple drones.
The solution space represents a planet. It has a state. The conditions (state) of the planet changes overtime. 
From the beginning of the game players can see the whole cycle. There will be no randomness when the solutions will run. So both players can see and explore exactly (via repl and ui) what the events will be. The scenario shows the surface of the planet as it changes daily. Scenario may run several rounds, each lasting, for example, a day.
Players can adjust after each round. And the final round can be, say, a week.
There planet surface contains consistent (no randomness, same) generated objectives. 
Now, this can be , say, a few simple points or a rich grid of entites and fields and whatever.
The goal of the scenario is, for example, to collect/research/visit this points.
If it is simple, players can hard-code their droid to literally go to each point. And it is completely vialble.
But, when a more complex grid and changing conditions (no randomness though, jsut changing) the goal of visting max number of points becomes more interesting.
Simply hardcoding ,say, 1000 points, becomes unrealistic, espacially if droid can get stuck/run out of energy between points.
The correct approach is to observe/study the environment (state) of the planet, provided api (what is possible for droids to know/do) and program the droid to auto-decide where to go.
A player  may choose build one complex droid and program it to never run out of energy and visit some number of locations.
Another palyer may choose to built more simple droids, even of of different kind (give them sevral programs). They will fail faster, but may visit more locations.

Fleets scneario.
Resource space represents planets and stations where you (using apis) can build ships and assemple a team.
Solution space represent a square grid where positions matter.
A player programs the ships, positions them on thier side of the solution space.
For example, you may program a ship 'when damage is taken, assess the enviroment (using solution space api), if such-such, move closer to your other ships, otherwise move towards  the opponent and attack'.
Both fleets operate simulteneously. For example, battle lasts 30 seconds. The remaninig fleet wins, or it's a draw and overtime. Players adjust and battle repeats. Overtimes continue until the winner is determined.

A strategy genre scneario.
Soltuion space is a map. In this genre of game players compete for resources.
Players are given resources and can collect more on the map. Players start by building/assempling their units/entities.
Say, there are 3-2-1-1-1 minute rounds with 30 seconds runs (after every ruound scneraio runs for 30 seconds).
After each round the state of the map persists to the next round. So like in real time stratgy, resources are finite and oppoents actions affect your soltuion.
For example, after first 3 minutes players (using provided elements and apis) built/assembled their units. They program their teams/squads/armies to operate on the map.
The first 30 second run puts the map in a new state. Players can now explore the new state and adust/compose further.
Units can collect resources or attack or anything else, within the boundaries of this particular scenario.

A guide scenario.
Introduces a player to the game via examples.

Evolving solution (e.g. one droid, changing environments) scenario.
For example, players are buidling systems (one or many droids) for planet exploration or other objectives.
Within the scneario, multiple planets are generated (each having a unique resource and solution space, and even different objectives).
Players' builds persist from round to round, such that it has to perform operations in different environemnts (planets).
For exampple, players play a macro game with 10-8-6-4-2 minut rounds. 
In the first round players build their system from the first resource and solution space (planet). They can explore resource and solution spaces for all rounds. 
Obviously, there is not enogh time for detailed analysys of all the next rounds, so they can only get the idea of what kinds of objectives their build will resolve each round.
They focus on the first round, but build the system generically enough to change during the next round.
The more specific you build is for the round, the harder it will be to adapt to the next soltuion space. 
It means, that the player who builds more generacally and parametarized will succeed more, as they will be able to adapt their code faster and accomplish more within each round.
The point of the scenario is: playing a longer game, where you build a more sophiscticated more generic  multi-purporse solution.
 
## Approach to creating the game, game evolution.
A better way is to build around diverse scenarios.
Instead of creating one-all-incompassing scenario, use multiple scenarios within a match, tournament.
For example, game comes with a number of default scenarios, each being quite simple and specific, but unique in terms of graphics and reosurce/solution space organization.
Players can select scenarios for the match, event, veto within their e.g. bo3 or bo5.
Scenarios can be created without strict guidelines. This would allow for more creative and exciting scenarios to appear.
And the is no need to worry about every scenario being completely unfamiliar: the better, well built scenarios will become the standard naturally.
Scneario will need to be compatible with the game, obviously, but it should be possible to use different graphics appraoch in scnearios, different ui organization, as long as certain game criteria is matched.
So it one game, but multiple scenarios.
As game evolves, more rich scenarios will be developed, the better ones becoming a part of the 'standard set' used for tournaments and events.
