## merging on github

- use rebase pull request, it will put incoming commit after the last commit
- say upstream has commits `1-2-5` where numbers represetn time of commits
- and a fork has `1-2-3-4`
- after merge it will be `1-2-5-3-4`, and `3 4` commit hashes will change, as we wanted

## updating local fork afterwards

- say, when all that happened fork added another commit and has `1-2-5-6`, wheres upstream has `1-2-5-3-4`
- we do
```shell
git remote add upstream https://github.com/DeathStarGame/DeathStarGame
git fetch upstream
git rebase -i upstream/main

```
- it will show us only commit `6`, and after rebase it will be `1-2-5-3-4-6`, which is the desired outcome

## updating manually

- it's the same
- we clone the fork, add upstream, rebase onto it fork's changes and push to upstream
- the only difference from fork author is that we have credentials to push to upstream repo
- github does that with rebase pull request, except manually we even can squash commits (but unnecessary - fork author should do that and conflicts)

## conflicts: reoslving is up to fork/PR author

- simple: before creating a pull request or indicating that fork can be merged, fork author should rebase on top of upstream and resolve conflicts if any

## ~~many people, one project: using a branch(s) as a personal lab, hashes as snapshots~~

- <s>there is `upstream` repo https://github.com/DeathStarGame/DeathStarGame
- a contributor forks, and creates a `design` branch or `lab` branch or uses `main` for that and `upstream` branch to prepare pull requests
- contirbutor's branches are their choice and effectively are unrelated histories, and are never merged
- they are like repos, but as part of the same repo
- they are better than copying into directories (to make snapshots) because all is needed is to create a branch for snapshot and checkout a  new one from any point in history
- there is the `main/lab/design` branch that should be the deafult, so when we open contirbutor's repo we see there current state of mind
- and an `upstream` branch is where we manually copy/rebase/merge somehow files selectively from or lab branch while keeping notes and design
- so it's branches over copying repos and project.lab repo
- a couple more notes:
  - it's elegant, as all our creating process is within one repo, yet still linkable and persistent (we can link to branches, they are like subdirectories of repo)s
  - it's findable: again, we only need to find a fork and can see the whole picture
  - and we clone with a custom name to be able to open multiple snapshots in the editor simultenenously
- the docs and notes stay persistent, while implementations may be snaphostted, experimented
  - so our `main/design` branch has a consistent notes, docs (we don't delete those) but a changing src (we snapshot it, anc can delete-continue or checkout from point
  - but: we cannot simply checkout back in time, we'll lose notes, so better to move-delete-move and keep links/branches for snaphosts (better just hashes, can be checkout out the same)
- so essentailly, our for has only ever **two** branches - `main` and `upstream`, everyhting else are links to hashes
- we can consider `lab` subdir flow: keep all personal/experimetal files in `lab` directory, so that we can easier select/exclude on merge into `upstream`, and `upstream` goes into pull requests
- since we'll rebase only into upstream, this boils down to copying ; if we can somehow do it via interactive rebase - cool, but there is always a danger of accidentally commiting something from `lab` dir
- but that's fine, we can always delete `usptream` branch and copy it from upstream repo itself
- how to have `~/code/` contain both `DeathStarGame` and `cljctools`
  - well, it's trivial - it is exaclty our fork (plus some files)
  - and if we need a snaphost, we can clone in another dir and checkout hash (see both in the editor)</s>

## how to merge pull requests from github without merge commits 

- question is: how to avoid using patches, yet be able to "merge" github pull requets
- we cannot use github ui
  - it's a quick sand: a person may push to the PR branch right as we're about to press merge, so it's not an option
  - linux, clojure solve it by using patches: pacakge changes into a patch and attach is (to issues or email), then it is downloaded locally and we apply it 
  - although this is superb and fundamental, it is possible achive the same "immutability" of the patch via pull requests
  - another issue with github, is that none of the options - merge squash rebase - is acceptable
    - merge does --no-ff and creates merge commit, and that needs to be avoided
    - squash is even worse: it creates a new commit (like rebase, also) but a single one (a PR author may have sevaral meanigful commits, why not)
    - rebase - it rewrites history, so the PR author needs to rebase/push force those new commit from master onto his main, because it's a new hash
      - rebase should be used only for local cleanup
- well, the approach is outlined here https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16358418/how-to-avoid-merge-commit-hell-on-github-bitbucket
```shell
# see PR on github
# like with patches, we'll use command line

# to our fork repo we add the PR contributor's fork 
git remote add contributor_name https://github.com/contributor_name/DeathStarGame
git fetch contributor_name main # simulating a patch: create a local "immutable" version of a comtibutor PR branch
git fetch upstream # be sure upstream is updated  **and only one person should merge at a time
git checkout main # this should be exaclty our upstream main, so we can even do git checkout -b upstream upstream/main
--git merge --ff-only contributor_name/main # if should work, if github shows that PR is mergeable, otherwise note in PR that there is conflict
# no, that won't work, becase upstream may have new changes
# what we need to do is to discard the hash of contributor and always rebase their changes on tip of main
# so we pull (cleanly from usptream, just to get the lastest commits) 
# and we rebase from mainterners branch on top of main, craeting new hases and commit dates
# so we basically copied changes and lost dates... can --committer-date-is-author-date be used? but it's non linear, isn't it?
# otherwise, to keep commit times we have to .. 

git push upstream main:main # pay attention, as we are using oringin/main to push to upstream, so it should be in sync
```

  - and commit
    - https://github.com/clojure/clojurescript/commit/a15247a743d4d1c5d73224038f7289c447b38ca8
  - as we can see, commit has author's date, so it was merged
  - AND: the mail shows a different commit hash than the resulting in the repo, obviously; so what happens with git am (apply patches from mail/files)
    - the commit was made on AUg 13 and had presumably hash efb5c5d2
    - but it was sent on Sep 17 and sometime (unknown, untrackable with github) was applyed to repo
    - the authorship, including commit date is taken from patch file, so github shows "AUg 13"
    - but a *new* commit is created, with a hash relevant to that the repo at the moment of patch application
    - it's basically a rebase, which is literally that: replaying (read *commiting* as if git commit) changes onto curent branch
    - so the date - Aug 13 - and the way we see that commit is not the "time" of the hash (such thing doesn't exist)
    - it's like doing rebase with --committer-date-is-author-date, so we do create a new commit but use author's date for commit 
      - and yes, git am has tthe same option https://git-scm.com/docs/git-am#Documentation/git-am.txt---committer-date-is-author-date
      - > This allows the user to lie about the committer date by using the same value as the author date.
    - so patches = rebase 
    - if we use git 2.29 + to do `git rebase -i upstream/main --committer-date-is-author-date` we rewrite all our hashes, but committer dates are preserved, but what's the point? hash history is broken

  - > Occasionally, the maintainer may get merge conflicts when they try to pull changes from downstream. In this case, they can ask downstream to do the merge and resolve the conflicts themselves (perhaps they will know better how to resolve them). It is one of the rare cases where downstream should merge from upstream.
  - > If the maintainer tells you that your patch no longer applies to the current upstream, you will have to rebase your topic (you cannot use a merge because you cannot format-patch merges):
  - > You can then fix the conflicts during the rebase. Presumably you have not published your topic other than by mail, so rebasing it is not a problem.

## ~~thinking: rebase for upstream, merge for lab~~

- <s>we rebase and pick commits from lab and generate a new patch commit onto our fork's main branch
- that commit does not exist anywhere yet
- then we rebase-merge lineraly into upstream's main branch, generating a new hash again (we have a choice to lie or not with --committer-date-is-author-date)
- at this point
  - our fork/lab has a lot of commits, some which were picked and squashed into a commit and it is on fork/main branch
  - we went and rebase-merged this commit on top of upstream/main branch, so the patch has been delivered to the source branch
  - everybody now have to rebase their fork/main branches onto upstream/main, which is by design
  - now some more patches like that happen to upstream/main and now our `fork/lab` does not have the code, only fork/main does (because it's a mirror)
  - on branch fork/lab we do actual git merge with mereg commit: git merge upstream/main or origin/main, adding all the changes from upstream reapo into our branch and creating an extra merge commit
- that allows to take changes from upstream into lab
- and to go from lab to upstream, we go rebase,squash again</s>


## ~~DeathStarGame forkflow~~

- <s>`upstream` - is the source of the project, the https://github.com/DeathStarGame/DeathStarGame
- fork, create your `fork/lab` branch, commit at your pace but with respect: lab is our space as contirbutors, history of lab branch matters for consistency of links, so rebase wisely and as you go
- `fork/main` is a mirror of DeathStarGame repo, it is the actual fork
- `fork/lab` should have a `lab` directory or other that do not collide with any dirs or files inside `upstream/main` repo, and commits should be separate for both (so that during rebase we can pick only non-lab, actually valuable commits)
- once changes in `fork/lab` are ready, we update our `upstream/main` and fork `lab` branch into a tmp branch (`lab1`) and do `git rebase -i upstream/main` creating one squash commit
- then we create a pull request on github from our `fork/main` into `upstream/main`
- the maintainer of `upstream` does the rebase of those changes on top of main (creating new hash because there can be more changes and chooses whether or not to --committer-date-is-author-date, better not - author date exists already, committer can be different)
- now `upstream` has the changes and all the forks need to rebase their `fork/main` onto `upstream/main` - now everyone has the latest version of the project as part of their fork
- AND - the key moment - we `merge` `upstream/main` into our `fork/lab`, resolving conflicts if needed, so that everybody's unique lab now has the latest version of the project
- we are not limited to 2 branches, but these 2 should be the core/key branches , others are at fork's owner heart's content</s>

## fork is a fork, lab repo is lab repo

- project repo (any repo) must not have `lab` branches
- fork contains contributor's take on the project and other branches (views) as needed
- personal notes and research and design should have their own repo(s) - consistent, linkable and independent
- talk about it in a video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ND4PRp9GLJs


## forkflow

- fork, do stuff in `main`, rebase-squash into a nice commit, create a branch for PR like `main-PR` and create a PR on github
- maintainer will see the PR and will clone `main-PR` branch and add that change onto the tip of projects `main` (via a new rebase)
- it is exaclty like using git patches - once fork's branch is cloned, it is an "immutable" locally availble patch at the moment of rebase-merge
- once changes are added, PR will automatically closed - so no need to use github ui for rebase-merge (because locally it's an immutable patch and we have other options), you can remove `main-PR` branch 
- during all of that you could have been making further changes on your `fork/main` branch nad now it has new commits
- once you need changes from upstream, rebase your `fork/main` onto `upstream/main` - it means take the projects `main` branch and replay your changes on top of it
- another approach - merge changes from `usptream/main` into your `fork/main`
  - yes, we create an additional merge commit, but - it will be eventually rebase-squashed
  - but before that happens, that gives us a linear local history *before* we are ready for rebase, but already want changes (without the need for deceiving --committer-date-is-author-date)

## rebasing and merging: both are weclome

- rebase for local cleanup, merges for else
- https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/maintainer/rebasing-and-merging.html#rebasing-and-merging
- merges are explicit and atomic - can see all the steps and commit dates are preserved
- so merges are welcome
- but of course - use rebase as we go in our dev branches to keep the atomic steps explcit as well
